#
## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
## check services at 30 seconds intervals
#
set daemon 30

#
## Set syslog logging. If you want to log to a standalone log file instead,
## specify the full path to the log file
#
set log /var/log/monit.log

#
## Set the location of the Monit lock file which stores the process id of the
## running Monit instance. By default this file is stored in $HOME/.monit.pid
#
set pidfile /var/run/monit.pid

#
## It is possible to include additional configuration parts from other files or
## directories.
#
include /usr/local/etc/monit.d/*

#
## Monit has an embedded HTTP interface which can be used to view status of
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. The HTTP
## interface is also required if you want to issue Monit commands from the
## command line, such as 'monit status' or 'monit restart service' The reason
## for this is that the Monit client uses the HTTP interface to send these
## commands to a running Monit daemon. See the Monit Wiki if you want to
## enable SSL for the HTTP interface.
#
set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
    allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
    allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
